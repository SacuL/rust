### Intro: what is Rust?

Rust is a programming language that balances the power of writing low level code with the ease of modern languages. It has a powerfull compiler that catches classical mistakes, its own dependency manager and build tool (Cargo), and many more.

> "By striving for zero-cost abstractions, higher-level features that compile to lower-level code as fast as code written manually, Rust endeavors to make safe code be fast code as well." - [The Rust Programming Language](https://nostarch.com/Rust2018)


### Install

For Windows instructions see: [Windows install](windows_install).


### Docs

The `rustup` setup also install an offline documentation. Run `rustup doc` to browse. 
Additionally, the [official site](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) recommends:
 - "the book" ([The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/))
 - [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/): a collection of "small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust"
 - [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/): collection of runnable examples and exercises
 
I've begun my journey by reading "the book", but I also intend on checking the other two resources. I'll come back here with my personal thoughts on each of those.

### Begin

The [`Hello, World!` example](hello_world).
