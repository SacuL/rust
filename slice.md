# The Slice Type

Another data type that does not have ownership is the slice. Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection.

## String Slices
A string slice is a reference to part of a String, and it looks like this:

```rust
let s = String::from("hello world");

let hello = &s[0..5];
let world = &s[6..11];
```

Rather than a reference to the entire String, it’s a reference to a portion of the String.
The type that signifies “string slice” is written as `&str`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_string = String::from("hello world");

    // first_word works on slices of `String`s
    let word = first_word(&my_string[..]);

    let my_string_literal = "hello world";

    // first_word works on slices of string literals
    let word = first_word(&my_string_literal[..]);

    // Because string literals *are* string slices already,
    // this works too, without the slice syntax!
    let word = first_word(my_string_literal);
}

fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}
```

## Other Slices
String slices, as you might imagine, are specific to strings. But there’s a more general slice type, too. Consider this array:

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

Just as we might want to refer to a part of a string, we might want to refer to part of an array. We’d do so like this:

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let slice = &a[1..3];
```

This slice has the type `&[i32]`. It works the same way as string slices do, by storing a reference to the first element and a length. You’ll use this kind of slice for all sorts of other collections.
